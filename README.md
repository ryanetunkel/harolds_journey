Harold's Journey


This was initially a space to practice my skills in Python but came to be a project that was a bit larger.
I initially followed a pygame tutorial made by Clear Code on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
I began adding onto it and changing some of the code and the project came to be known as Harold's Journey.

The name Harold came about as the default sprite used in Clear Code's tutorial for an enemy was a snail.
My partner became rather attached to the snail and didn't want to see it be used as an enemy. 
She said it was he who was the main character and named him Harold.

Harold now rests safely upon the hat of whichever wizard is lucky enough to call him their friend. 
Harold cannot be hurt and he will always be there for his wizard.
This is Harold's Journey.
